## Goal of the Program

The goal of the program is to be able to do everything that a Magic the Gathering Player would want and/or need to figure out. It should only show the functionality that the user is concerned for and filter out the rest to cater for any Magic the Gathering player.

The major objectives of a Magic player using an App would need the following:

* A good life counter that works well on displaying everything needed for a **Commander** game, but still being legible
* The ability to find card rules and oracle text quickly
* The ability to trade cards easily with trusted prices
